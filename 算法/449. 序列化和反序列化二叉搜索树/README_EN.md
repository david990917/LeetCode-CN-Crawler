# [449. Serialize and Deserialize BST](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst)
 ### Description
<p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>

<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a <b>binary search tree</b>. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>

<p><b>The encoded string should be as compact as possible.</b></p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.</p>
